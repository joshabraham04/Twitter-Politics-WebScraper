1214547454760292352,2020-01-07 14:00:53,The banking industry wants you to believe people who file for bankruptcy are reckless or irresponsible. The truth is that they're struggling with rising costs and flat wages. One crisis is enough to send them over the edge. They don’t need shaming. They need relief.
1214547452667351045,2020-01-07 14:00:52,"Finally, I'll close the loopholes that allow the wealthy and corporate creditors to abuse the bankruptcy system at the expense of everyone else."
1214547451190886403,2020-01-07 14:00:52,"Bankruptcy also doesn’t affect all people equally. Women and people of color are more likely to file for bankruptcy, which is partly a reflection of wealth and income disparities.

1214547448263258113,2020-01-07 14:00:51,"We have a student loan debt crisis in America in part because our bankruptcy system makes it nearly impossible to get rid of that debt, even when you have nothing left.

1214547446619090945,2020-01-07 14:00:51,Bankruptcy law places certain spending limitations on people while they’re in the process of bankruptcy. My plan pares back some of those burdensome limits—like those that prevent families from paying rent—so families have a chance to recover after the bankruptcy process.
1214547444643618817,2020-01-07 14:00:50,"My plan starts by making it easier for people being crushed by debt to obtain relief through bankruptcy by streamlining the process, reducing the costs of filing, and giving people more flexibility in bankruptcy to find solutions that match their financial problems."
1214547442584166401,2020-01-07 14:00:50,"In 2005, the banking industry pushed through a bill to change our bankruptcy laws so they could squeeze everything they could out of families.

1201863809838784512,2019-12-03 14:00:36,Giant companies are raking in profits while squeezing working families to the breaking point. It's time to put more power in the hands of workers. My plan ensures that the 27 million part-time workers in America are treated with respect and can build a future for their families.
1201863808148525058,2019-12-03 14:00:36,"And it's time to remove the perverse incentives that keep giant corporations from making their workers full-time. I'll extend leave and benefit protections to part-time workers, and require employers to offer additional hours to existing part-time workers before hiring new ones."
1201863806210789376,2019-12-03 14:00:35,My plan will give workers who work at companies with more than 15 employees the rest they desperately need by guaranteeing workers 11 hours between shifts and compensating them with higher pay for hours voluntarily worked within that window.
1201863804650508290,2019-12-03 14:00:35,"Under my Fair Workweek Plan, employers with 15 or more employees will be required to give two weeks’ advance notice of work schedules. And employees will be empowered to ask for schedules that work for them, without fear of retaliation."
1201863802981175303,2019-12-03 14:00:34,"These unpredictable schedules make it nearly impossible to work another job, go back to school, or schedule child care. And workers of color—especially women of color—bear the brunt of these abusive scheduling practices."
1201863801311780865,2019-12-03 14:00:34,Millions of workers face unpredictable schedules that can change dramatically day-to-day—even by the hour—with almost no advance warning. A third of workers involuntarily work part-time because they aren't assigned enough hours by giant corporations trying to keep costs down.
1201863798883270657,2019-12-03 14:00:33,"As corporations rake in larger profits, working families across the country are getting crushed by rising costs and wages that are barely budging. Adding to their challenges, many employers—especially in the retail and service industries—are using algorithms to assign schedules."
1201863796521938945,2019-12-03 14:00:33,Unpredictable work schedules are leaving too many part-time workers with no control over their time and not enough hours to make ends meet.

1163799908501151744,2019-08-20 13:08:15,"Investing in public safety should mean investing in good schools, safe housing, access to mental health services and treatment for addiction, protecting LGBTQ+ Americans, and violence intervention programs diverting young people from criminal activity—before police are involved."
1163799906844364806,2019-08-20 13:08:14,"Let's start by reimagining how we talk about public safety. It's a false choice to suggest a tradeoff between safety and mass incarceration.
